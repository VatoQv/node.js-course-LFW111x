Steps to run the app:

Open two terminal windows, both with the current working directory set to project's root folder. 
In the first terminal window, we'll start our server like so:

    node server.js

When we run this command, the process will remain open and there should be no output.
In the second terminal window, we'll serve our files:

    serve -p 5050 static
